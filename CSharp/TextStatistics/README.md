Kata Text Statistics and Indicators

Given a chunk of text (long string) you should produce some basic statistics, such as:
● Word frequency: how many times appears, in that text, each word
● Characters frequency: how many times appears, in that text, each character
● Total characters in the text
● Total words in the text
● Characters (without spaces) to words ratio: total characters, excluding spaces, divided
by total words. Example 130 chars / 30 words = 4.33 (chars per word)
